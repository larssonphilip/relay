# ⚡ Relay

**Relay is a local-first AI assistant for home automation, development, and electronics.**  
It connects intent to action — in your home, your lab, and your terminal.

Relay runs on your own machine, uses your tools, and controls *real systems*: devices, services, files, code, and hardware. No cloud magic, no black boxes, no pretending to be human.

Just signals in. Actions out.

## Why Relay?

Most AI assistants are great at talking.  
Relay is built to **do**.

- 🔌 Control lights, switches, sensors, and relays  
- 🛠 Help with development, debugging, and workflows  
- ⚙️ Assist with electronics, firmware, and hardware projects  
- 🧠 Remember context over time, locally and transparently  
- 🏠 Designed for smart homes *and* messy workbenches  

Relay is opinionated, modular, and intentionally boring where it matters.

## Core Principles

- **Local-first** — runs on your hardware, owns your data  
- **Action-oriented** — every capability maps to something real  
- **Explicit > clever** — readable code, predictable behavior  
- **Permissioned autonomy** — nothing happens without your say  
- **Hackable by default** — easy to extend, easy to break, easy to fix

## What Relay Is (and Isn’t)

✅ A practical assistant for automation and making things  
✅ A developer tool you can trust with your environment  

❌ Not a chatbot personality  
❌ Not a cloud SaaS  
❌ Not “fully autonomous” (on purpose)

## Example

```bash
Coming soon
```

Intent in. Execution out.

## Status

🚧 Relay is under active development.  

The goal is a small, powerful core with a growing set of skills for:
- Home automation  
- Development workflows  
- Electronics & embedded systems  

If it feels like something you’d want running quietly in the background of your life — you’re in the right place.
